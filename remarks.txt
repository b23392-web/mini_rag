------Trade-offs I made

I avoided paid services → saved money, spent time

I used local models → more control, more setup pain

I kept things simple → easier to start, harder to grow

None of these are wrong. Each choice just moves the difficulty somewhere else.

-----Limits of the current setup

Data disappears when the app stops

Only one piece of text is handled properly

Frontend is fragile

Not suitable for many users or long documents

This is normal at this stage.

------What I can realistically do next

Freeze features and stabilize one working flow

Make document upload work reliably

Store data permanently

Clean the UI slowly

Add checks so errors don’t fail silently
